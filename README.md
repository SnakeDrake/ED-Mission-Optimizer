I created this tool because i make various hauling mission and it's a pain to find station wtih all the commodities i want.

So as you can see in this screen, my tool search the log for identifying the mission needing commodities, the quantities need then based on your station search a certain radius and display the station where you can find all of them, or if no stations has all, different station where you can find a maximum of them.

Actually the tool identify your ship and the Pad Size and filter the station with this and propose what you can charge for sell to the destination station and what you can take at the destination station if the commodities you search are not enough to fullfill your cargo capacity.

But i don't have all of the ship in the game so if you load a ship that my tool don't know, you can enter the pad size :

Then you can manually save, and if if you can i want the content of the file settings.json so i can complete the tool.

A big thanks for the guys who created Ardent-Insight, this tool is based on their API.

In this new version, if you don't have any mission available who need commodities, this tool can provide the better trade route for your station (it's a bit long actually but i work on the improvment) :
