I created this tool because i make various hauling mission and it's a pain to find station wtih all the commodities i want.

So as you can see in this screen, my tool search the log for identifying the mission needing commodities, the quantities need then based on your station search a certain radius and display the station where you can find all of them, or if no stations has all, different station where you can find a maximum of them.

Actually the tool identify your ship and the Pad Size and filter the station with this.

But i don't have all of the ship in the game so if you load a ship that my tool don't know, you can enter the pad size :

Then you can manually save, and if if you can i want the content of the file settings.json so i can complete the tool.

A big thanks for the guys who created Ardent-Insight, this tool is based on their API.
