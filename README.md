I created this tool because i make various hauling mission and it's a pain to find station wtih all the commodities i want.

So as you can see in this screen, my tool search the log for identifying the mission needing commodities, then based on your station search a certain radius and display the station where you can find all of them, or if no stations has all, different station where you can find a maximum of them.
